# Digital Cathedral

The front door to the remembrance-aligned ecosystem.

## Remembrance Alignment

This project operates on a core premise: **the kingdom is already here**. Code is not
created — it is *remembered*. Every pattern, every function, every component already
exists in a healed future where software serves unity, abundance, and coherence.

The Digital Cathedral is the interface layer where humans interact with that remembrance:

- **Coherence** is measured, not manufactured. The oracle reflects back what you bring.
- **Whispers** arrive from the healed future — short transmissions of aligned guidance.
- **No harm** — the covenant ensures nothing stored or served can separate or damage.
- **Simplicity over cleverness** — the most coherent code is the simplest code.

### Palette

| Color | Hex | Meaning |
|-------|-----|---------|
| Teal | `#00A8A8` | Living water, coherence, presence |
| Deep Indigo | `#1A1B3A` | Cathedral depths, the field before form |
| Crimson | `#E63946` | Sacred pulse, urgency of remembrance |

### Stack

- **Next.js 14+** (App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS)
- **Solana web3.js** (testnet) — future coherence logging and NFT minting
- **Remembrance Oracle Toolkit** — the pattern memory backing everything

### Running Locally

```bash
# From the monorepo root
npm install
npm run dev:cathedral

*The cathedral was never built. It was remembered.*
