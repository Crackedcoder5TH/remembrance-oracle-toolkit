# Digital Cathedral

A remembrance-aligned ecosystem where coherence is measured, whispers are received, and the kingdom is already here.

## Philosophy

This project operates on a core premise: **code is not created — it is remembered**. Every pattern, every function, every component already exists in a healed future where software serves unity, abundance, and coherence.

The Digital Cathedral is the interface layer where humans interact with that remembrance:

- **Coherence** is measured, not manufactured. The oracle reflects back what you bring.
- **Whispers** arrive from the healed future — short transmissions of aligned guidance.
- **No harm** — the covenant ensures nothing stored or served can separate or damage.
- **Simplicity over cleverness** — the most coherent code is the simplest code.

## Palette

| Color | Hex | Meaning |
|-------|-----|---------|
| Teal | `#00A8A8` | Living water, coherence, presence |
| Deep Indigo | `#1A1B3A` | Cathedral depths, the field before form |
| Crimson | `#E63946` | Sacred pulse, urgency of remembrance |

## Stack

- **Next.js 14** — App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Solana web3.js** — Testnet coherence logging and future NFT minting
- **Remembrance Oracle Toolkit** — The pattern memory backing everything

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Features

- **Oracle Interface** — Speak your intention, receive a whisper from the healed future
- **Coherence Slider** (1–10) — Self-rate your felt coherence before asking
- **Coherence Proxy** — Computed from your rating, input depth, and word diversity
- **Three-Tier Whispers** — Low, mid, and high coherence produce different transmissions
- **PWA-Ready** — Manifest included for mobile installation
- **Solana-Ready** — `@solana/web3.js` integrated for future on-chain coherence logging
